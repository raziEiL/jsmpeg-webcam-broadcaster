# Simple GUI for webcam streaming in MPEG1
JSMpeg Webcam Broadcaster â€” abstracts the complex command-line usage (partial) of [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) into an application.  
The app is aimed to streaming from a web-camera in TS format of MPEG1 for [jsmpeg](https://github.com/phoboslab/jsmpeg) | [jsmpeg-player](https://github.com/cycjimmy/jsmpeg-player) player.

## Usages:
jsmpeg-webcam-broadcaster (client) > websocket (backend) > jsmpeg player (frontend)

## Language:
Due this application is developed for a small community speaking on my native language I didn't add English translation.  
But is not hard to understand the meaning of the app fields.
