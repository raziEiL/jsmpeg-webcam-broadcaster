# Simple GUI client for webcam streaming in MPEG1
JSMpeg Webcam Broadcaster — abstracts the complex command-line usage (partial) of [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) into an application.  
The app is aimed to streaming from a web-camera in TS format of MPEG1 for [jsmpeg](https://github.com/phoboslab/jsmpeg) | [jsmpeg-player](https://github.com/cycjimmy/jsmpeg-player) player.

## How it works
jsmpeg-webcam-broadcaster (client) > websocket (backend) > jsmpeg player (frontend)

## JSMpeg Server
[jsmpeg-server-relay](https://github.com/raziEiL/jsmpeg-server-relay)

## Language
Due this application is developed for a small community speaking on my native language I didn't add English translation.  
But is not hard to understand the meaning of the app fields.
